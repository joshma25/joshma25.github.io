<p> Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are a great threat in the modern day and can have a major effect on people using the free internet since they can prevent individuals from accessing services and websites. Ethernet connections are how a vast majority of people access the Internet and this project analyzes how different ethernet cables are affected by DDoS attacks using ns-3 simulations. This study hopes to draw relationships between the number of attacker bots and the data rate of a given ethernet cable. After proceeding with our experimentation and simulations, we found that the relationship between these two variables is an inverse linear relationship (1/t). As the data rate of the cable increases, the delay caused by DDoS attack congestion decreases. This relationship was determined by measuring the time taken for a packet to be sent to a server and received back during a DDoS attack. We conclude that choosing an ethernet cable with faster data rates does improve performance under the load of a DDoS attack, however, our simulation environment was not very realistic. Despite this, the relationships drawn from this study may still be used in real world wired network applications.
