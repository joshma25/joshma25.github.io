<p> Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are a great threat in the modern day and can have a major effect on everyone using the free internet. Wifi and Ethernet connection are how a vast majority in how people access the internet and this project plans to analyze the effects of a DDoS attack on both of these communication systems. This study will do simulations using ns-3 software to see how both Wifi and Ethernet connection perform under throttle of a DDoS attack with changing variables of signal speed, strength and throughput. This study hopes to draw conclusions about the differences between Wifi and Ethernet while under the load of a DDoS attack and to determine the optimal variable settings to maximize bandwidth during these attacks.  </p>
